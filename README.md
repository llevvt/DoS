This is a simple DoS script written with python. It is free to use, but note, that it is only for legal use. 

Usage

This script can be used as a command from your terminal, just simply copy this repository and run with sudo permissions. 
IMPORTANT: check if you have change the path to interpreter. By default, it is !/bin/python3, but this path can be different for your system.

Also, make sure that you have changed the value of -t (--time_frame) flag. By default, this value is 0.0, but your own tcp buffer would be overflowed really fast, thus you have to increase this value.
